This is my final year project I created whilst doing my degree in ICT with Business at
the University of Bradford. Although it was meant to be based on the Rock music scene
up in Northern England, I decided that the importance of Ruby on Rails should be taken
in to more consideration so I just included random content. It has many greate features such as
the admin page which can be accessed if the 'jetinder?' method is true along with the 
access method which controls access to edit and destroy pages depending on the 'jetinder?' method
in the Application controller. 

Features of this project include a sign up, log in, log out and forgot password (in which
an email gets sent to a Gmail account)product catalogue, articles page with comments, 
contact form  and a static downloads page is included to demonstrate how static pages
are created in the MVC architecture of Rails. Other than the pages that have been stated, 
This project also includes pagination and images in the product catalogue.
